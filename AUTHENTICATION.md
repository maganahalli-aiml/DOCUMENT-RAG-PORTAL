# Authentication System Documentation

## Overview
The Document RAG Portal now includes a comprehensive authentication system with role-based access control.

## User Accounts

### Default Users
The system comes with two pre-configured user accounts:

#### 1. Admin User
- **Username:** `admin`
- **Password:** `admin`
- **Role:** Administrator
- **Access:** Full access to all features including the Evaluation page

#### 2. Guest User
- **Username:** `guest`
- **Password:** `guest`
- **Role:** Guest
- **Access:** Limited access - cannot view the Evaluation page

## Features

### üîê Login Screen
- Clean, modern login interface
- Username and password authentication
- Password visibility toggle
- Form validation and error handling

### üë§ User Profile Display
- User information shown in sidebar
- Current role displayed
- Logout functionality

### üõ°Ô∏è Role-Based Access Control
- **Admin Role:** Can access all pages including Evaluation
- **Guest Role:** Restricted access - Evaluation page is hidden and protected

### üîí Route Protection
- Automatic redirect to login for unauthenticated users
- Admin-only routes are protected with proper error messages
- Session persistence using localStorage

## Usage

### Logging In
1. Open the application at http://localhost:3001
2. You'll be automatically redirected to the login screen
3. Enter credentials manually:
   - For admin access: username: `admin`, password: `admin`
   - For guest access: username: `guest`, password: `guest`

### Navigation
- Once logged in, navigation is filtered based on user role
- Admin users see all menu items including "Evaluation"
- Guest users see all menu items except "Evaluation"

### Logging Out
- Click the logout button in the sidebar
- Or click the logout icon in the mobile header
- You'll be redirected back to the login screen

## Technical Implementation

### Components
- `AuthContext.tsx` - React context for authentication state management
- `Login.tsx` - Login form component
- `PrivateRoute.tsx` - Route protection wrapper
- `Layout.tsx` - Updated with user profile and role-based navigation

### Security Features
- Client-side authentication with localStorage persistence
- Role-based route protection
- Graceful access denied handling for unauthorized users
- Automatic login state restoration on page refresh

### Development Notes
- Authentication state is managed using React Context
- User credentials are stored in localStorage for session persistence
- The system is designed for easy extension with additional roles and users
- All routes are protected by default - unauthenticated users see only the login screen

## Testing the System

### Admin Access Test
1. Login with admin/admin credentials
2. Verify access to all pages including Evaluation
3. Check that user profile shows "Admin" role

### Guest Access Test
1. Login with guest/guest credentials
2. Verify that Evaluation page is not visible in navigation
3. Confirm access denied if trying to access /evaluation directly
4. Check that user profile shows "Guest" role

### Session Persistence Test
1. Login and navigate around the app
2. Refresh the browser
3. Verify that authentication state is maintained
4. Logout and confirm redirect to login screen

## Future Enhancements
- Add user registration functionality
- Implement password change feature
- Add more granular permissions
- Integrate with backend authentication API
- Add password strength requirements
- Implement session timeout
